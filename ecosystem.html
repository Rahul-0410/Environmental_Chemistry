            <h2> 10 years Ago</h2>
            <p>Before 10 years ago, many ecosystems were already facing significant challenges due to human activities
                such as deforestation, overfishing, pollution, and climate change. Tropical rainforests, for example,
                had already experienced significant deforestation, leading to the loss of habitat for many species and
                contributing to climate change. Coral reefs were also experiencing declines due to ocean acidification
                and bleaching events caused by rising sea temperatures.These challenges have led to the degradation and
                loss of many ecosystems and their biodiversity. <br>
                1. Deforestation was a major issue that continued to happen at an alarming rate, particularly in the
                tropical regions of the world. This led to the loss of biodiversity, the degradation of soil quality,and the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. <br>

                2. Water pollution was another significant problem, with various sources of pollutants, such as
                agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage, contaminating water bodies worldwide. This not onlyaffected aquatic ecosystems but also posed a significant threat to human health. <br>

                3. Climate change was also an issue that was recognized 10 years ago, although the extent and urgency of
                its impact were not as widely acknowledged as they are today. <br>
                4. Overall, 10 years ago, there was already a growing recognition of the need to address environmental
                issues, but the scale and complexity of the challenges were not as widely understood as they are today.
                Since then, there has been a greater focus on sustainability and conservation efforts, as well as a more
                widespread recognition of the need to take action to protect our planet.

            <h2>Present Scenario</h2>
            <p>In the present, the state of ecosystems is still concerning, and in some cases, worsening. The loss of
                habitat and fragmentation of ecosystems due to human activities also continue to threaten the survival
                of many species. For example, many marine species are at risk due to overfishing, pollution, and habitat
                destruction. <br>
                1. The world's ecosystems are facing numerous challenges due to human activities such as deforestation,
                overfishing, pollution, and climate change. These challenges have already led to the degradation and
                loss of many ecosystems and their biodiversity. <br>
                2. One of the most pressing challenges facing ecosystems today is climate change. As global temperatures
                rise, ecosystems are facing increased stress from changes in precipitation patterns, more frequent and
                severe weather events, and changes in the distribution of plant and animal species. This can lead to
                reduced productivity, biodiversity loss, and increased vulnerability to diseases and invasive species.
                <br>

                3. Another challenge facing ecosystems is habitat loss and fragmentation. As human populations continue
                to grow and expand into natural areas, ecosystems are being destroyed and fragmented, leading to the
                loss of habitat for many species. This can result in decreased biodiversity, increased competition among
                species, and increased risk of extinction.

            <h2>Coming Years</h2>
            <p>Looking ahead to the coming 5 years, it is likely that we will continue to see the effects of present
                challenges, as well as the emergence of new ones. Climate change will continue to be a major threat to
                ecosystems, and we can expect to see increased stress on ecosystems due to changes in precipitation
                patterns, more frequent and severe weather events, and changes in the distribution of plant and animal
                species. We can also expect to see continued habitat loss and fragmentation due to human activities,
                leading to the loss of biodiversity and increased competition among species. <br>
                1. Overfishing and unsustainable fishing practices are also major threats to marine ecosystems. Many
                fish populations have already been depleted, and some are on the brink of extinction. In the coming
                years, it will be important to implement sustainable fishing practices to ensure that marine ecosystems can continue to support the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on them. <br>

                2. In addition to these challenges, emerging threats such as the spread of invasive species and the
                impacts of emerging diseases may become more prevalent in the coming years. The COVID-19 pandemic has
                highlighted the risks associated with the spread of zoonotic diseases from wildlife to humans,
                emphasizing the need for better understanding and management of these risks.

            <h2>How to Conserve Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>There are many steps that can be taken to preserve the ecosystem and ensure a better future for our
                planet. Here are some of the key actions that individuals, organizations, and governments can take: <br>
                1. Reduce, reuse, and recycle <br>
                2. Conserve energy<br>
                3. Protect biodiversity<br>
                4. Adopt sustainable practices<br>
                5. Advocate for environmental policies<br>
                6. Education and awareness <br>
                <img src="https://apcp.es/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3Rs-english-1024x576.png" alt="img" class="ima"> <br>

                By taking these steps and working together, we can preserve the ecosystem and ensure a better future for ourselves and future generations. <br>
                Moreover efforts to protect and restore ecosystems are increasing around the world, and new technologies
                and innovations are emerging to address the challenges we face. For example, renewable energy
                technologies are becoming more widespread, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and decreasing
                greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable agriculture and forestry practices are also being developed to
                reduce the impact of human activities on ecosystems.
