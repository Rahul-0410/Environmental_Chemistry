            <p style="user-select: auto;">The Greensaviours Initiative is to work on a project, to research the Changes
                in the ecosystem in our neighborhood from the last 10 years and expected changes in the coming 5 years.
                <strong>Our mission</strong> is to research the changes which have already happened,the scauses and
                effects of these changes.</p>
            <p>An ecosystem is a structural and functional unit of ecology where the living organisms interact with each
                other and the surrounding environment. In other words, an ecosystem is a chain of interactions between
                organisms and their environment. The term “Ecosystem” was first coined by A.G.Tansley, an English
                botanist, in 1935.</p> <br><br>
            <h2>Structure of the Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>
                The structure of an ecosystem is characterised by the organisation of both biotic and abiotic
                components. This includes the distribution of energy in our environment. It also includes the climatic conditions prevailing in that particular environment. <br><br>

                The structure of an ecosystem can be split into two main components, namely: <br>

                Biotic Components <br>
                Abiotic Components <br> <br>
                The biotic and abiotic components are interrelated in an ecosystem. It is an open system where the
                energy and components can flow throughout the boundaries.</p> <br><br>
