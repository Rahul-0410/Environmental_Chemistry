            <h5><span class="pro">Project:</span> <span>Changes in the ecosystem in your neighbourhood from last 10 years and expected changes in the coming 5 years</span></h5>
              <p>The ecosystem in our neighborhoods is a complex system that is constantly evolving and adapting to changing environmental conditions. Over the past 10 years, there have been several significant changes in the ecosystem of many neighborhoods, with some being positive and others negative. These changes have been caused by a variety of factors, including climate change, urbanization, and human activities.
                <br><br>
                In this project, we will analyze the changes that have occurred in the ecosystem of our neighborhood over the past 10 years and predict the expected changes in the coming 5 years. We will investigate how these changes have affected the flora and fauna, air and water quality, and the overall health of the ecosystem. Additionally, we will examine the factors that have contributed to these changes and explore potential solutions to mitigate the negative impacts.
                <br><br>
                By understanding the current state of our ecosystem and predicting future changes, we hope to raise awareness about the importance of preserving our environment and encourage action towards sustainable practices. Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights and recommendations to local authorities, residents, and stakeholders on how to protect and enhance the health of our neighborhood's ecosystem for generations to come.</p>
